    <div id="p5_loading" class="loadingclass"><p style="Barlow">Welcome to the buffering page of my site. While the site is loading let me explain how it works. It is not important that you read all this text, but, in case of particularly slow internet connection, at least you have something to do while waiting. This website tells about my photographic style, my personality, the protagonists of my shots. If you stumbled upon this page you are probably looking for a photographer. Well, know from now that there are only 20 of my shots on this site. Besides, only shots in 16: 9 ratio. This is because from here I want you to understand who I am as much as possible, because you will not choose me for my ability to press the shutter button, but for my ability to tell stories. In creating interactions, interest, experiences. On instagram or on behance maybe you can see all my shots. Here instead I will introduce you to my personality. You will need intuition, I have not put many instructions in fact. You will need to want to spend a few minutes of your time playing with my photos. And if you're still reading this buffering, you'll probably need a faster internet connection. Ok I'm finally done talking, now let's start generating.
